HORIZON-JPL 0.1.7
==================
This Python API, is an effort towards opening NASA's PDS data sets to the public with a focus on 
ease of access. Thus creating, NASA's JPL Horizons On-Line Ephemeris System API

Download the package from: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/HorizonJPL or from pip:
      ```
      pip install horizonjpl
      ```

Please note, this API is currently in development and things are subject to change in future versions.

Future Plans
------------------------------

Things yet to be implemented from HORIZON system:
 - Ephemeris and Trajectory calculations
 - Small Body advanced search
 - Convenience API calls

Creating a robust fault tolerant API is the number one goal. Included in this goal is various subgoals:
 - Easy to access/read documentation
 - Ultra fast response parsing
 - Utilize cache wherever makes the most sense without affecting the integridy of the data
 - Simple RESTful API


Background
------------------------------
From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris:
```
For scientific uses, a modern planetary ephemeris comprises software that generates positions of planets and often of 
their satellites, asteroids, or comets, at virtually any time desired by the user.
```
